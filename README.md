# WikiWatch
Welcome to _WikiWatch_, a repository for the source code that will inherently be aimed at marking changes and revisions to the United States' Congressional Representative and Senators. 
This application will run a Twitter bot that can be found in a link below once complete, linking itself with the Wikipedia API that can (hopefully) mark the author of changes, changes made, and time of change - then sharing those publicly on Twitter. The basic idea is to keep these Representatives and Senators accountable, whilst ensuring that changes to the Wiki pages are made visible. 

Currently, this project's status is still an idea, and I haven't executed it yet, but I am in the process of drafting ideas and methods of construction. Keep posted for details as the project is updated.
